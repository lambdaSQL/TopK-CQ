- improvements in writing quality
  - We have revises several section
x duplication network is confusing
  x  warmup was not clear. 
  x  Clearly state how to generalize (required!)
  x  missing proof of correctness/security (required!)

x switch net,
  x give concrete example (required!). 
  x In the description of the phases, state in english then using fomrula (opposite of what is there now)


- compare with 2pc switch net. And perm network (GC and HE).

x obliv perm is actually an oblivious injection. Make this clear. See Review 1 for complaint.

- micro benchmarks.

- compare with VaultDB

- Compare with Google Join-and-Compute protocol




Minor comments:
x Size of cuckoo hash table?
x Note that we are open source. 
x Review states "Section 3.4, various places, m should be [m]."
x Include page numbers
x Justify honest majoirty 3pc
x State the KKRT can not be made composable without very large overhead.
